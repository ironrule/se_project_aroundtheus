**Intro**

This project was a challenge to create the site from the Figma design and then make sure it is responsive to different device sizes. I began by building out the basic elements of the site in HTML, adding class names and following BEM methodology. I then created the structure of CSS files to style the site, taking care to match the project to the Figma design.

The second phase of this project involved making a window to edit the user's name and title. I created this with HTML and CSS, then added Javascript functionality to allow the window to operate properly, passing the name and title values to the modal and to the main page once edited. I then removed the HTML for my cards and generated them dynamically with Javascript, using querySelector, cloneNode, and writing functions for the array as an iterative loop.

The third phase of this project included adding functionality to allow the user to add new cards, delete cards, click the like buttons, and implement some optimizations in Javascript to allow the site to function more efficiently.

The site is currently hosted on GitHub Pages at the following address:

You can review the site in DevTools and inspect each element, as well as change page sizes to see how it will look on different devices. As we were given 2 designs in Figma, some of the different sizes had to be styled based on what looked or worked best.

**Video**

Below is a link to the video that I created for my site, to show the different features used in the development of this project.

**Figma**

After loading this design, I was able to export the necessary images for my project. This Figma design gave us a mockup of the site for small devices of 320 pixel width screens, and a regular desktop site of around 1280 pixels in width.

**Images**

Below are links to the images of my site while viewing in DevTools to see the different sizes and how the site changes to adapt to them.

**Future Plans**

Future plans for this site include coding the back-end to allow saving changes permanently, and editing features. This will be accomplished with additional Javascript, CSS and HTML.
