**Intro**

This project was a challenge to create the site from the Figma design and then make sure it is responsive to different device sizes. I began by building out the basic elements of the site in HTML, adding class names and following BEM methodology. I then created the structure of CSS files to style the site, taking care to match the project to the Figma design.

The site is currently hosted on GitHub Pages at the following address:

You can review the site in DevTools and inspect each element, as well as change page sizes to see how it will look on different devices. As we were given 2 designs in Figma, some of the different sizes had to be styled based on what looked or worked best.

**Video**

Below is a link to the video that I created for my site, to show the different features used in the development of this project.

After loading this design, I was able to export the necessary images for my project. This Figma design gave us a mockup of the site for small devices of 320 pixel width screens, and a regular desktop site of around 1280 pixels in width.

**Images**

Below are links to the images of my site while viewing in DevTools to see the different sizes and how the site changes to adapt to them.

**Future Plans**

Future plans for this site include making interactive buttons, edit features, and allowing users to add more images. This will be accomplished with Javascript, additional CSS and HTML.
